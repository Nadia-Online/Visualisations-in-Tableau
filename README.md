### 📈  Shifts in UK Employment Market (2011-2014) 

This repository contains data visualisation projects developed in Tableau to analyse regional economic shifts in the United Kingdom. The data set is named as UK Industrial Employment Trends (EMSI) and was provided by JustIT.

### Situation

Economic fluctuations between 2011 and 2014 significantly impacted UK regions, requiring a clear way to distinguish between broad economic trends and specific industrial shifts.

### Task

Create a comprehensive visualisation suite in Tableau that allows stakeholders to navigate between high-level regional overviews and granular sector-specific analysis.

### Action

- **Data Architecture:** I utilised a dual-layer dataset structure consisting of 1-digit (Broad Industries) and 2-digit (Detailed Sub-industries) sheets to allow for hierarchical exploration.
- **Visual Strategy:** I developed two distinct dashboards using geographic maps for spatial distribution (highlighting the cities where changes were sharper), bar charts for ranking, and heat maps to visualise the intensity of sector shifts per specific cities.
- **Analytical Validation:** I performed a cross-sheet validation using Swansea as a control. By tracing a +42.7% growth in the broad Arts & Entertainment sector down to specific sub-sectors, I ensured the accuracy of my calculated fields and data joins across the entire workbook.

### Result & Key Findings

The final product is a multi-dashboard setup that identifies a "two-speed" economy across the UK:

- **Regional Growth Divergence:** The analysis highlighted significant localised booms, such as Aberdeen’s Administrative and Support sector, which grew by +32.2% (adding over 7,200 jobs).
- **Granular Insights:** The "drill-down" functionality revealed that growth in one area often masked declines in others. For instance, in Swansea, the high growth in leisure was contrasted by a sharp -21.9% decline in Professional and Scientific services.
- **Public Sector Contraction:** Traditional sectors faced widespread challenges, notably in Birmingham, where Public Administration and Defence saw a -5.3% decrease, representing a loss of 2,680 jobs.

### 💡 Insights

To understand the UK economy, we often look at the "average" trend, but the sources suggest that the most extreme data points—the outliers—provide the most critical lessons. To be clear, we are not suggesting that national trends are "hiding" inside these anomalies. Instead, we pay attention to outliers because they serve as essential signals for organizations to either encourage or prevent specific economic shifts.

First, outliers act as "Success Blueprints." For example, while professional services grew in many places, Nottingham-Derby saw a massive 47.9% surge. By studying the driving forces behind this specific success, other cities can learn how to replicate that growth.

Second, outliers are "Early Warning Signs." The sharp -27.0% drop in Public Administration in Cardiff-Newport and -26.7% in Swansea are localized shocks. If an organisation wants to prevent such declines from spreading, it must understand the forces—such as budget shifts or relocation—behind these specific extremes.

Finally, outliers help us distinguish between speed and magnitude. The public should understand that an outlier in percentage can be different from an outlier in actual jobs.Swansea’s 53.2% growth in Real Estate is a high-speed outlier but represents only 1,241 jobs. In contrast, London’s 19.4% growth in the Professional sector added over 100,000 jobs, showing massive scale. 

By watching how these extremes evolve, the public can better understand where the economy is "tilting" and prepare for the future.
